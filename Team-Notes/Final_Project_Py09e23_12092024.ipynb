    "## **Business Idea**\n",
    "\n",
    "A website that provides a general Overview for goods of different market brands in order to compare prices and get a wider overview of accessable goods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Problem Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "- In today’s fast-paced, highly competitive marketplace, consumers are overwhelmed by the variety of goods, brands, and prices available across different stores and online platforms. With limited time and resources, customers often struggle to efficiently compare prices and quality, leading to suboptimal purchasing decisions. There is a lack of a centralized platform that provides a comprehensive, real-time comparison of goods from multiple brands and markets, making it difficult for users to identify the best value for their money.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - In Germany we have different Supermarkets, such as Kaufland, Lidl, REWE, EDEKA, Aldi, etc, All of them have different type of products, brands, and special prices and promotions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - When people go shopping, there are so many different stores and brands selling the same kinds of things. It’s hard for them to know which store has the best price or which product is the best. Right now, people have to check lots of different websites or stores one by one to compare prices. This takes a lot of time and can be confusing. (Polina will continue)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Imagine your family wants to buy a big bag of rice, and different stores sell the same type of rice. One store sells it for $30, another for $25, and another for $20, but you don’t know which store has the lowest price without checking all the websites or visiting the stores. So, you have to spend a lot of time going through different websites, writing down the prices, and figuring out where to buy it for the best deal.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Wouldn’t it be much easier if there was one website that showed you all the prices from every store in one place? That way, you could quickly see which store has the cheapest rice, saving you time and money!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Solution Statement -> Business Mission Statement** \n",
    "\n",
    "- Our website will serve as a centralized platform that allows consumers to easily compare prices and features of goods from various brands across multiple markets. By aggregating real-time data on product availability, pricing, and user reviews, we will empower users to make informed purchasing decisions. Our intuitive interface will enable users to filter and sort products based on their preferences, ensuring they find the best value for their needs. With personalized recommendations and alertsfor price drops, our platform will enhance the shopping experience, ultimately saving users time and money.\n",
